Data Science Capstone Project: Formula 1 Prediction Streamlit App- DATS 4001\n\nAbout: The goal of this project is to analyze Formula 1 (F1) racing data to understand its main factors that influence race outcomes and driver performance. F1 has over 70 years of historical racing data, Formula 1 provides a unique dataset for predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. The project will focus on these questions -\n\nWhat factors most strongly predict whether a driver finishes in the top 3?\n\nHow do pit stop strategies and weather affect outcomes?\n\nCan we predict finishing positions given qualifying results, lap times, and car/team data?\n\n[Dats 4001 - Project Report](documents/DATS_4001_Final_Report.pdf)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n2.

It combines polynomial regression and logistic regression to model unemployment rates and classify their directional change, with model performance evaluated using metrics such as MSE, R², accuracy, and confusion matrices.\n\n[Download my Project Paper](documents/Dats_FinalProject2024.pdf)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n4.

The results showed that AI-based grading dramatically decreased grading time, improved rubric adherence, and produced useful feedback, while still requiring human oversight for edge cases and ethical concerns.\n\n[AI REV Final Paper](documents/Ai%20Rev%20final%20project.docx)\n\n\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\\_\n\n5.
