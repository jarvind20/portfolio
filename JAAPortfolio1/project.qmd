1.  Data Science Capstone Project: Formula 1 Prediction Streamlit App- DATS 4001

About: The goal of this project is to analyze Formula 1 (F1) racing data to understand its main factors that influence race outcomes and driver performance. F1 has over 70 years of historical racing data, Formula 1 provides a unique dataset for predictive modeling, statistical analysis, and data visualization. The project will focus on these questions -

What factors most strongly predict whether a driver finishes in the top 3?

How do pit stop strategies and weather affect outcomes?

Can we predict finishing positions given qualifying results, lap times, and car/team data?

2.  Data Visualization - US Presidents Shiny App Project - DATS 2102

An interactive dashboard of U.S. Presidents, featuring data updated through 2023.”

About: The U.S. Presidents Dashboard is an interactive R Shiny application that allows users to select any U.S. president from a dropdown list and explore related data or visualizations for that leader, presenting information tailored to the selected president. The app is designed as a user-friendly dashboard to help users compare presidents or dive deeper into specific details about each administration

3.  Data Mining - US Job Employment Project - DATS 2103

About: This project analyzes U.S. employment and unemployment trends using historical data from 1974–2024, applying data visualization, feature engineering, and both regression and classification models to understand and predict changes in unemployment. It combines polynomial regression and logistic regression to model unemployment rates and classify their directional change, with model performance evaluated using metrics such as MSE, R², accuracy, and confusion matrices.

4.  AI Revolution - Professors Using GPT-4 to Grade in University Essay - SMPA 3194

About: This project investigated the use of GPT-4 to automate the grading of short university level written assignments in order to reduce instructor workload while maintaining consistency, fairness, and quality of feedback. The results showed that AI-based grading dramatically decreased grading time, improved rubric adherence, and produced useful feedback, while still requiring human oversight for edge cases and ethical concerns.
