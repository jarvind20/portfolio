<td align="left">Score: 3/5. The writing is clear but lacks argument and
concept use.</td>
<td align="left">While climate change is a universally recognized issue,
the response from governments around the world has been uneven. Some
countries have pledged net-zero targets, but critics argue that these
are insufficient without legally binding enforcement mechanisms. The
author mentions policies like the Paris Agreement but fails to explain
how they operate or why they may be ineffective.</td>

<tr>
<td align="right">2</td>

<td align="left">Despite clarity issues, the argument is sound and one
concept is used.</td>

<td align="left">Score: 4/5. Despite unclear phrasing, the argument is
strong and uses a concept.</td>
<td align="left">Artificial intelligence offers exciting possibilities
in healthcare, from diagnosis to robotic surgery. However, the student
jumps between ideas too quickly. The ethical concerns about privacy and
bias are mentioned but not fully explained. Overall, the response feels
rushed and difficult to follow.</td>

analysis.</td>
<td align="left">Social media plays a major role in shaping teenage
mental health today. While some studies show benefits in social
connection, others highlight increased anxiety and depression. The

psychological studies or course theories on digital behavior.</td>

<td align="left">None needed</td>
<td align="left">Score: 5/5. Excellent across all criteria.</td>
<td align="left">This essay compares Marx’s view on capitalist
inequality with Rawls’ theory of justice. It clearly explains how Marx
sees class struggle as inevitable under capitalism, while Rawls proposes
that fairness can be achieved through redistributive mechanisms. The
response uses specific quotes from both thinkers and applies them to
modern wealth gaps.</td>
